# Working with GLakeMap (Gacial Lake Mapping) Python Package

## 1. Installing machine learning packages
	- Download and install Anacnonda software in your machine; links below for details:
		- https://www.anaconda.com/
		- https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
	- Open the Command Prompt window and type conda list. The command should list a lists of packages availabe in the environemnt. If the command fails to list the packages, add Anacnonda to the PATH or use  Anaconda Prompt instead.
	- Once conda command works, create a  virtual environment and install Python (Python 3.6 recommended) and the following packages:
		
		conda install -c anaconda numpy
		conda install -c anaconda scipy
		conda install -c anaconda matplotlib
		conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn
		conda install -c anaconda pandas0 ```

1) Make glakemap package (..\..\glakemap-dev\glakemap) the current working directory.

2) Open and edit the "config.py" file. Directions for How To are provided as comments.
